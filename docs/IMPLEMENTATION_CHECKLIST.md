# Implementation Checklist - Quick Reference

**Last modified:** 2025-12-28

**STOP! Before implementing ANY feature, complete this checklist in order:**

## Phase 1: EXPLORE (No Coding!)
- [ ] Read GitHub issue completely
- [ ] Read `/docs/SPEC.md` relevant sections
- [ ] Read `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` relevant sections
- [ ] Explore existing code WITHOUT writing anything
- [ ] Use `Task tool with subagent_type=Explore` for complex navigation

## Phase 2: PLAN
- [ ] Use `think hard` to evaluate approaches
- [ ] Create detailed implementation plan
- [ ] Identify test scenarios
- [ ] Document plan in comment/file

## Phase 3: TEST (TDD)
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests FIRST
- [ ] Verify tests FAIL (no mocks)
- [ ] Commit tests: `git commit -m "test: add X tests"`

## Phase 4: IMPLEMENT
- [ ] Write code to pass tests
- [ ] Run tests after each change
- [ ] DO NOT modify tests to pass
- [ ] Iterate until ALL tests pass

## Phase 5: VERIFY
- [ ] Use subagents to verify correctness
- [ ] Check for edge cases
- [ ] Verify matches SPEC.md
- [ ] Ensure follows ARCHITECTURE.md

## Phase 6: COMMIT
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code linted and formatted
- [ ] Type checks pass
- [ ] Commit: `git commit -m "feat: implement X\n\nFixes #N"`
- [ ] Create PR if needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**DON'T:**
- Jump to coding immediately
- Skip writing tests first
- Modify tests to make them pass
- Ignore SPEC/ARCHITECTURE docs
- Skip verification steps

**DO:**
- Explore thoroughly before coding
- Plan with thinking time
- Write tests before implementation
- Follow TDD cycle religiously
- Verify with subagents

---

## Success Criteria

A successful implementation has:
- All tests written first and passing
- Matches SPEC.md requirements
- Follows ARCHITECTURE.md patterns
- No security vulnerabilities
- Clean, maintainable code
- Updated documentation
- Meaningful commit messages

**Remember:** Quality > Speed. Following this checklist ensures successful implementations.
